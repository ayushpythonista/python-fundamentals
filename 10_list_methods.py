Using deque for Frequently Removal

If we frequently need to remove elements from the start of the list then Pythonâ€™s collections.deque provides a more efficient solution. Deques are optimized for appends and pops from both ends, which makes them faster than lists for such operations.

Explanation:

* deque() converts the list a into a deque object, this allowing efficient insertions and removals from both ends.
* a.popleft() removes and returns the first element in constant time (O(1)), making it far more efficient compared to a list for such operations.

NOTE: Adding or removing items at the start or end of a list takes a lot of time (O(n)) because all other elements need to shift. Whereas, deque do the same operations in just O(1) time.
