Python Functions is a block of statements that return the specific task. The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can do the function calls to reuse code contained in it over and over again.

"""Functions as First-Class Objects
In Python, functions are first-class objects, meaning that they can be treated like any other object, such as integers, strings, or lists. This gives functions a unique level of flexibility and allows them to be passed around and manipulated in ways that are not possible in many other programming languages"""

Types of Python Function Arguments
Python supports various types of arguments that can be passed at the time of the function call. In Python, we have the following function argument types in Python:

Default argument
Keyword arguments (named arguments)
Positional arguments
Arbitrary arguments (variable-length arguments *args and **kwargs)
"""

# Default argument
"""
A default argument is a parameter that assumes a default value if a value is not provided in the function call for that argument.

"""
Keyword Arguments
The idea is to allow the caller to specify the argument name with values so that the caller does not need to remember the order of parameters.

example is that suppose we have defined (firstName, lastName) function parameter
so either we can pass them in sequence or we can use names directly and so it donot require sequece

def student(firstName, lastName):

"""
Position-only arguments mean whenever we pass the arguments in the order we have defined function parameters in which if you change the argument position then you may get the unexpected output. We should use positional Arguments whenever we know the order of argument to be passed. So now, we will call the function by using the position-only arguments in two ways and In both cases, we will be getting different outputs from which one will be correct and another one will be incorrect.

Recursive Functions in Python
Recursion in Python refers to when a function calls itself. There are many instances when you have to build a recursive function to solve Mathematical and Recursive Problems.

Using a recursive function should be done with caution, as a recursive function can become like a non-terminating loop. It is better to check your exit statement while creating a recursive function.

Return Statement in Python Function
The function return statement is used to exit from a function and go back to the function caller and return the specified value or data item to the caller. The syntax for the return statement is:

return [expression_list]
The return statement can consist of a variable, an expression, or a constant which is returned at the end of the function execution. If none of the above is present with the return statement a None object is returned.
"""

# NOTE: in Python every variable name is a reference. When we pass a variable to a function Python, a new reference to the object is created.
